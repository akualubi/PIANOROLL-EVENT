## üìù Abstract
Symbolic music representation is a fundamental challenge in computational musicology. While grid-based representations effectively preserve pitch-time spatial correspondence, their inherent data sparsity leads to low encoding efficiency. Discrete-event representations achieve compact encoding but fail to adequately capture structural invariance and spatial locality. To address these complementary limitations, we propose Pianoroll-Event, a novel encoding scheme that describes pianoroll representations through events, combining structural properties with encoding efficiency while maintaining temporal dependencies and local spatial patterns. Specifically, we design four complementary event types: Frame Events for temporal boundaries, Gap Events for sparse regions, Pattern Events for note patterns, and Musical Structure Events for musical metadata. Pianoroll-Event strikes an effective balance between sequence length and vocabulary size, improving encoding efficiency by 1.36√ó to 7.16√ó over representative discrete sequence methods. Experiments across multiple autoregressive architectures show models using our representation consistently outperform baselines in both quantitative and human evaluations.
